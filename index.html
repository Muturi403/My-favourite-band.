    <h2>All about Westlife.</h2>
    <p id="pine">It was in 1997 in Sligo,Ireland where westlife members, Kian Egan, Mark Feehily and Shane Filan were discovered by <em> "Boyzone's"</em> manager <em> Louise Walsh!</em>
       He gave them an audition to be in his new Boyband "Westlife", but out of all the 6 boys in Ioyou only Kian, Mark, and Shane got through, then in Ireland the auditions continued for one more spot but 2 joined instead; Nicky Byren and Bryan Mcfadden.
       Later they were all signed to a record label by <em> Simon Cowell</em> and in 1999 Westlife released their first single <em>"Swear it again."</em>

       The amusing part with the band is their vocals, i just love their songs and choreography.
